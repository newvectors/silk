// TestServiceUIFrameDrainsPostedTasksAndBeats covers what both GLFW loops owe
// the rest of the framework once per iteration, and what ShowModal's loop used
// to skip: it ran timers and animations but neither drained the UI task queue
// nor fed the watchdog. A task posted from a background goroutine — a dlv step
// callback, an LSP result, a git refresh, a toast — was therefore queued with
// nothing to run it for as long as the dialog stayed open, and the watchdog,
// beating only in MainLoop, warned that the event loop had stopped for the
// whole of a perfectly healthy modal.
//
// The service work is asserted here rather than through ShowModal itself: the
// modal loop blocks in glfw.WaitEventsTimeout, an AppKit call that may only run
// on the thread init() pinned, and a test function never runs on it. What the
// loop actually calls is checked separately by
// TestModalLoopServicesTheUIFrame — between them, deleting either call from
// serviceUIFrame or the serviceUIFrame call from the modal loop turns a test
// red.
